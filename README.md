# Fraction Calculator


Calculates the result and outputs it in a fraction format.


This program uses stacks and dictionaries.

# How it works

This program outputs the result using two stacks, namely, ```numStack``` and ```opStack```.
It also utilises a dictionary class

```numStack``` - this stack holds all the numbers in Fractions in the given arithmetic expression


```opStack``` - this stack holds all the operators in the given arithmetic expression


```myDict``` - the dictionary used to retrieve or insert variable values

# Example

Given arithmetic expression

```x12=12+(2/3)```


this input should give the correct output of 38/3


This program currently supports all four operators for the arithmetic of fractions(+,-,*,/).
